# Driver metrics

This feature is available only under the crate feature `metrics`.

During operation the driver collects various metrics.

They can be accessed at any moment using `Session::get_metrics()`

### Collected metrics:
* Query latencies
* Total number of nonpaged queries
* Number of errors during nonpaged queries
* Total number of paged queries
* Number of errors during paged queries
* Number of retries
* Latency histogram statistics (min, max, mean, standard deviation, percentiles)
* Rates of queries per second in various time frames
* Number of active connections, and connection and request timeouts

### Example
```rust
let metrics = session.get_metrics();

println!("Queries requested: {}", metrics.get_queries_num());
println!("Iter queries requested: {}", metrics.get_queries_iter_num());
println!("Errors occurred: {}", metrics.get_errors_num());
println!("Iter errors occurred: {}", metrics.get_errors_iter_num());
println!("Average latency: {}", metrics.get_latency_avg_ms()?);
println!(
    "99.9 latency percentile: {}",
    metrics.get_latency_percentile_ms(99.9)?
);

let snapshot = metrics.get_snapshot()?;
println!("Min: {}", snapshot.min);
println!("Max: {}", snapshot.max);
println!("Mean: {}", snapshot.mean);
println!("Standard deviation: {}", snapshot.stddev);
println!("Median: {}", snapshot.median);
println!("75th percentile: {}", snapshot.percentile_75);
println!("95th percentile: {}", snapshot.percentile_95);
println!("98th percentile: {}", snapshot.percentile_98);
println!("99th percentile: {}", snapshot.percentile_99);
println!("99.9th percentile: {}", snapshot.percentile_99_9);

println!("Mean rate: {}", metrics.get_mean_rate());
println!("One minute rate: {}", metrics.get_one_minute_rate());
println!("Five minute rate: {}", metrics.get_five_minute_rate());
println!("Fifteen minute rate: {}", metrics.get_fifteen_minute_rate());

println!("Total connections: {}", metrics.get_total_connections());
println!("Connection timeouts: {}", metrics.get_connection_timeouts());
println!("Requests timeouts: {}", metrics.get_request_timeouts());
```
