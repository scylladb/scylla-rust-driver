    // ### Q: Where do APPLICATION_NAME, APPLICATION_VERSION and CLIENT_ID come from?
    // - there are no columns in system.clients dedicated to those attributes,
    // - APPLICATION_NAME / APPLICATION_VERSION are not present in Scylla's source code at all,
    // - only 2 results in Cassandra source is some example in docs:
    //   https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/d3cbf9c1f72057d2a5da9df8ed567d20cd272931/doc/modules/cassandra/pages/managing/operating/virtualtables.adoc?plain=1#L218.
    //   APPLICATION_NAME and APPLICATION_VERSION appears in client_options which
    //   is an arbitrary dict where client can send any keys.
    // - driver variables are mentioned in protocol v5
    //   (https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/d3cbf9c1f72057d2a5da9df8ed567d20cd272931/doc/native_protocol_v5.spec#L480),
    //   application variables are not.
    //
    // ### A:
    // The following options are not exposed anywhere in Scylla tables.
    // They come directly from CPP driver, and they are supported in Cassandra
    //
    // See https://github.com/scylladb/cpp-driver/blob/fa0f27069a625057984d1fa58f434ea99b86c83f/include/cassandra.h#L2916.
    // As we want to support as big subset of its API as possible in cpp-rust-driver, I decided to expose API for setting
    // those particular key-value pairs, similarly to what cpp-driver does, and not an API to set arbitrary key-value pairs.
    //
    // Allowing users to set arbitrary options could break the driver by overwriting options that bear special meaning,
    // e.g. the shard-aware port. Therefore, I'm against such liberal API. OTOH, we need to expose APPLICATION_NAME,
    // APPLICATION_VERSION and CLIENT_ID for cpp-rust-driver.

    // Application identity can be set to distinguish different applications
    // connected to the same cluster.
