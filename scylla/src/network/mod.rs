//! This module holds entities that represent connections to the cluster
//! and management over those connections (connection pooling).
//! This includes two main abstractions:
//! - Connection - a single, possibly encrypted, connection to a Scylla node over CQL protocol,
//! - NodeConnectionPool - a manager that keeps a desired number of connections opened to each shard.
