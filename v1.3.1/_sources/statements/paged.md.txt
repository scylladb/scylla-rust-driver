# Paged query
Sometimes query results might be so big that one prefers not to fetch them all at once,
e.g. to reduce latency and/or memory footprint.
Paged queries allow to receive the whole result page by page, with a configurable page size.
In fact, most SELECTs queries should be done with paging, to avoid big load on cluster and large memory footprint.

## `QueryPager`

The automated way to achieve that is `QueryPager`. It always fetches and enables access to one page,
while prefetching the next one. This limits latency and is a convenient abstraction.

> `QueryPager` is quite heavy machinery, introducing considerable overhead. Therefore,

> for non-SELECTs.

On API level, `Session::query_iter` and `Session::execute_iter` take a [unprepared statement](unprepared.md)
or a [prepared statement](prepared.md), respectively, and return a `QueryPager`. `QueryPager` needs
to be converted into typed `Stream` (by calling `QueryPager::rows_stream::<RowT>`) in order to
deserialize rows.

> ***Note***\
> Due to lending stream limitations of Rust, `QueryPager` currently only enables deserialization
> of owned types (i.e., those with `'static` lifetime). If you want to deserialize borrowed types
> (such as slices, `&str`, etc.) in order to save allocations, you should use the manual paging
> method (described in a section **Manual Paging** below).

> ***Warning***\
> In case of unprepared variant (`Session::query_iter`) if the values are not empty
> driver will first fully prepare a statement (which means issuing additional request to each
> node in a cluster). This will have a performance penalty - how big it is depends on
> the size of your cluster (more nodes - more requests) and the size of returned
> result (more returned pages - more amortized penalty). In any case, it is preferable to
> use `Session::execute_iter`.

### Examples
Use `query_iter` to perform an [unprepared query](unprepared.md) with paging:
```rust
use futures::stream::StreamExt;

let mut rows_stream = session
    .query_iter("SELECT a, b FROM ks.t", &[])
    .await?
    .rows_stream::<(i32, i32)>()?;

while let Some(next_row_res) = rows_stream.next().await {
    let (a, b): (i32, i32) = next_row_res?;
    println!("a, b: {}, {}", a, b);
}
```

Use `execute_iter` to perform a [prepared query](prepared.md) with paging:
```rust
use scylla::statement::prepared::PreparedStatement;
use futures::stream::StreamExt;

let prepared: PreparedStatement = session
    .prepare("SELECT a, b FROM ks.t")
    .await?;

let mut rows_stream = session
    .execute_iter(prepared, &[])
    .await?
    .rows_stream::<(i32, i32)>()?;

while let Some(next_row_res) = rows_stream.next().await {
    let (a, b): (i32, i32) = next_row_res?;
    println!("a, b: {}, {}", a, b);
}
```

Statement values can be passed to `query_iter` and `execute_iter` just like in an [unprepared statement](unprepared.md)

### Configuring page size
It's possible to configure the size of a single page.

On a `Statement`:
```rust
use scylla::statement::unprepared::Statement;

let mut query: Statement = Statement::new("SELECT a, b FROM ks.t");
query.set_page_size(16);

let _ = session.query_iter(query, &[]).await?; // ...
```

On a `PreparedStatement`:
```rust
use scylla::statement::prepared::PreparedStatement;

let mut prepared: PreparedStatement = session
    .prepare("SELECT a, b FROM ks.t")
    .await?;

prepared.set_page_size(16);

let _ = session.execute_iter(prepared, &[]).await?; // ...
```

## Manual paging
It's possible to fetch a single page from the table, and manually pass paging state
to the next query. That way, the next query will start fetching the results
from where the previous one left off.

On a `Query`:
```rust
use scylla::statement::unprepared::Statement;
use scylla::response::{PagingState, PagingStateResponse};
use std::ops::ControlFlow;

let paged_query = Statement::new("SELECT a, b, c FROM ks.t").with_page_size(6);

let mut paging_state = PagingState::start();
loop {
    let (res, paging_state_response) = session
        .query_single_page(paged_query.clone(), &[], paging_state)
        .await?;

    // Do something with `res`.
    // ...

    match paging_state_response.into_paging_control_flow() {
        ControlFlow::Break(()) => {
            // No more pages to be fetched.
            break;
        }
        ControlFlow::Continue(new_paging_state) => {
            // Update paging state from the response, so that query
            // will be resumed from where it ended the last time.
            paging_state = new_paging_state
        }
    }
}

```

> ***Warning***\
> If the values are not empty, driver first needs to send a `PREPARE` request
> in order to fetch information required to serialize values. This will affect
> performance because 2 round trips will be required instead of 1.

On a `PreparedStatement`:
```rust
use scylla::statement::unprepared::Statement;
use scylla::response::{PagingState, PagingStateResponse};
use std::ops::ControlFlow;

let paged_prepared = session
    .prepare(Statement::new("SELECT a, b, c FROM ks.t").with_page_size(7))
    .await?;

let mut paging_state = PagingState::start();
loop {
    let (res, paging_state_response) = session
        .execute_single_page(&paged_prepared, &[], paging_state)
        .await?;

    let rows_res = res.into_rows_result()?;

    println!(
        "Paging state response from the prepared statement execution: {:#?} ({} rows)",
        paging_state_response,
        rows_res.rows_num(),
    );

    match paging_state_response.into_paging_control_flow() {
        ControlFlow::Break(()) => {
            // No more pages to be fetched.
            break;
        }
        ControlFlow::Continue(new_paging_state) => {
            // Update paging state from the response, so that query
            // will be resumed from where it ended the last time.
            paging_state = new_paging_state
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance
For the best performance use [prepared statements](prepared.md).
See [statement types overview](statements.md).
