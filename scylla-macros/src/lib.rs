///
/// At the moment, only structs with named fields are supported.
///
/// Serialization will fail if there are some fields in the Rust struct that don't match
/// to any of the UDT fields.
///
/// If there are fields in UDT that are not present in Rust definition:
/// - serialization will succeed in "match_by_name" flavor (default). Missing
///   fields in the middle of UDT will be sent as NULLs, missing fields at the end will not be sent
///   at all.
/// - serialization will succeed if suffix of UDT fields is missing. If there are missing fields in the
///   middle it will fail. Note that if "skip_name_checks" is enabled, and the types happen to match,
///   it is possible for serialization to succeed with unexpected result.
///
/// This behavior is the default to support ALTERing UDTs by adding new fields.
/// You can forbid excess fields in the UDT using `forbid_excess_udt_fields` attribute.
///
/// In case of failure, either [`BuiltinTypeCheckError`](../scylla_cql/serialize/value/struct.BuiltinTypeCheckError.html)

/// ```text

/// ```
